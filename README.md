# Advent of Code - Day 1 and Day 2 Challenges

This repository contains the solutions for Day 1 and Day 2 of the Advent of Code challenges.

## Day 1 - Python Solutions
For Day 1, both exercises were solved using Python. Python is a great language for handling files and working with lists, which made the implementation straightforward.

## Day 2 - C# Solutions
For Day 2, I chose to implement the solutions using C#. This was an opportunity for me to practice and improve my skills with C#.

## Repository Structure
- **Day 1**: Contains Python scripts for solving the challenges.
- **Day 2**: Contains C# projects for solving the challenges.

Feel free to explore the solutions and adapt them for your own learning or challenges!
